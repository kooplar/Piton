This is the virtual machine for the piton language. It is a stack based
virtual machine.

to compile the virtual machine:

cd src && make

to run a test using a previously compiled piton source file:

src/piton tests/big_test

to run it in debug mode, use '-d' before the piton bytecode file:

src/piton -d tests/big_test

type help in the debugger for more info on its usage. Currently the
debugger doesnt not dislay the piton source code, only the byte code.
However it is possible to place breakpoints, print variable values, among
other utilities.
